# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What are props in React?

Your answer: Props are values that the parent component contains, but it needs to be passed down to the children in order to be used. Because without passing it down the child component has no idea what it is. It is one of the only ways to pass down information from the parent to the children components. Props = propertys.

Researched answer: Props or propertys is a keyword in React that allows data or information to be passed to components in a uni-directional flow only downstream. From parent to child or from 'older' child to 'younger' child. I have used props when creating React applications and I have to pass information down to a child component for example I have passed down functions to a child component in order to use it in that specific component. This is also called functional props.

2. What is a DOM event?

Your answer: DOM or Document Object Model is something React uses in order to render new expierences for the users. When React senses a change in a component from the user it goes into the DOM and updates the UI without reloading the page.

Researched answer: The Document Object Model is a programming interface for web applications. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style and content. I have used the DOM when I build React applications and the UI needs updating the DOM changes what needs to be changed and re renders the page.

3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object Oriented programming is when everything in the programming language is an object for example in Ruby arrays, strings, and pretty much any data type is an object which means you can use object . dotation and built in methods on pretty much any data type and functions in Ruby are considered methods because its all derived from a class object. Functional programming is JS where functions are functions and normal data types are not objects.

Researched answer: OOP is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods. The main ideas behind OOP are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. While functional programming avoids shared state and mutable data as scene in OOP. Functional programming empahizes expressions and declarations rather than execution of statements. I have used OOP in the new languauge we learned called Ruby a major difference i have found is that when using Ruby you do not need return values or declarations everything is simple and easier to read on the dev side.

4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: Because we are talking about Ruby a Float and an Integer are both different classes. A float is a decimal and an integer is a whole number. Both can be easily changed into one or the other unlike in JS or functional programming.

Researched answer: In Ruby a float is considered any number with a decimal for example 123.0 is a float while and interger would be 123. I have used both when first diving into Ruby challenges, we had to add integers and floats.

5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: An implicit return is something I breifly mentioned in OOP but it is when a function in Ruby does not need a return to run the return is implicit and Ruby will run the last line of code in that function.

Researched answer: In Ruby a method is returned without using the keyword return. It is implicitly ran on the last line of code in that method. I have used implicit return any time I create a method in Ruby.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: are variables which are declared in a class but outside of the constructors, methods, or blocks. They are accessible to all constructors, methods, or blocks in the class.

2. PostgreSQL: is the primary data store or data warehouse for all web and mobile applications.

3. Ruby on Rails: is a dev tool that gives devs a framework providing structure for all code they write. It helps devs build websites and front end applications. Kind of similar to React.

4. ORM: is a programming technique where a metadata descriptor is used to connect object code to a relational database

5. Active Record: it is an arciteciual pattern used in software engineering.
